<blockquote>
<p>BEM recommends to modify blocks like this <code>&lt;div class=&quot;block block_mod&quot;&gt;</code>. Why not to use the simple version like <code>&lt;div class=&quot;block mod&quot;&gt;</code>? Since we now have combined selectors <code>.block.mod</code>, it&#39;s easy to define all the CSS properties to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recommendation to prefix modifier CSS class with its block name has multiple reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, since it is possible to mix several blocks and elements at the same DOM node, we need to ensure that a modifier would affect only
the block it belongs to. Let&#39;s say that we have a menu item element and a button mixed together. In HTML this construction is represented
by the following markup:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;menu__item button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case adding <code>.active</code> modifier to them would affect both.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;menu__item button active&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All the 3 sit at the same DOM node, so it is impposible to differentiate if we mean <code>menu__item.active</code> or <code>button.active</code>.
Whereas in the prefixed case the naming <code>button_ative</code> unambiguously says as that this is only the button that has to be
affected.</p>
<p>Another point is CSS specificity. The combined selectors are more specific (means more important) than single class selectors.
This means that you might have trouble when redefining them with parent block code.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
  &lt;button class=&quot;button active&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you are already having <code>.button.active</code> selector in code, the specificity of your redefining <code>.header .button</code> would be exactly
the same as the specificity of modifier combined selector which makes you dependent on the order of the CSS rules
declared. Whereas in case of using a prefixed modifier you can always be sure that the cascade selector <code>.header .button</code> will
overwrite the <code>.button_active</code> modifier.</p>
<p>This makes life easier especially for maintainable projects.</p>
<p>The third point is that looking at the <code>&lt;div class=&quot;block block_mod&quot;&gt;</code> markup you can clearly see the block structure. It is easy
to recognize that we are having a block and its modifier and there is no different interpretations here. Unfortunately a grasp onto
<code>&lt;div class=&quot;block mod&quot;&gt;</code> code does not give such information. Depending on what are the exact CSS classes sometimes it is impossible
to recognize if we are having a block and a modifier or a mix of 2 blocks here. This might be even more confusing if the names of the
entities are complex or contracted/abbreviated (which sometimes happens in big projects).<br/>
Clear understanding of a block structure especially helps in looking for corresponding code on a file system.</p>
<p>You will also appreciate <code>.block_mod</code> practice when refactoring and use global search over all your project files. Imagine the
same looking for not-prefixed <code>.mod</code> and all the HTML pieces it might be in.</p>
<p>And lastly, from a development process standpoint the difference between <code>.block.mod</code> and <code>.block_mod</code> is only one symbol. Using
<code>-</code> instead of <code>.</code> costs nothing but it brings all the benefits listed above. Moreover, since pre-processor began to support BEM
notation, it is pretty natural to write <code>&amp;_mod</code> there and finally get a modifier declared as it was recommended.</p>

          <div class="raw-text"><h2 id="why-do-i-need-css-classes-for-block-instead-of-using-semantical-custom-tags-">Why do I need CSS classes for block instead of using semantical custom tags?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Blocks can be respesented as custom tags which we may define CSS rules for. Looks like we do not need CSS classes for blocks
at all. They can be used for modifiers only, like <code>&lt;button class=&quot;mod&quot;/&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using custom tags as block selectors is indeed one of the BEMish solutions and can be used. However this variant is less
flexible than the recommended &quot;class&quot; approach.</p>
<p>This is more likely that you would need to prefix modifier classes with their block name to provide them namespace.
The details are uncovered in <a href="#why-the-modifier-classes-are-prefixed">&quot;Why the modifier CSS classes are prefixed with their parent block name?&quot;</a>
question. So, finally the custom-tag version of a block is like <code>&lt;block class=&quot;block_mod&quot;/&gt;</code>. This does not look
very different from <code>&lt;div class=&quot;block block_mod&quot;&gt;</code> especially assuming that being tag-independent you can use any
custom node and stay with <code>&lt;block class=&quot;block block_mod&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Second drawback is that &quot;tag&quot; version makes using the mixes of blocks impossible whereas the &quot;class&quot; version
represent that naturally by <code>&lt;div class=&quot;block1 block2&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>And the last clench against such an approach is that in many cases you are not able to represent your blocks with
custom tags at all. For a <code>link</code> block you definitely need <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, and the same for <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.</p>

          <div class="raw-text"><h2 id="can-i-create-a-global-modifier-applicable-to-any-block-">Can I create a global modifier applicable to any block?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve heard that global modifiers like <code>visible</code>, <code>invisible</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>opacity50</code> are not welcomed in BEM. Why?
I think it is useful to incorporate common properties like this in such a global class and then apply it to different blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed you can have 2 main CSS classes at the same DOM node. In BEM we call it <code>mix</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;block1 block2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But important thing about it is that both <code>block1</code> and <code>block2</code> should be standalone blocks. This is slightly different
from what people usually mean by &quot;global modifiers&quot; as modifiers do not have any sense on they own and are just a set
of properties to change.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;block globalmod&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you think that in your case you would have a global modifier, these are the problems you may face:</p>
<p>First of all the specificity problem appears. In a local modifier case CSS code goes like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.block {
  display: block;
}
.block_hidden {
  display: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Both block and modifier selectors have the same specificity. As modifier declaration goes after the block, it redefines the CSS
properties. These styles belong to block and are stored in the block file. Thus, independently on how the resultant CSS is built
from source, you will always have them in this order and be sure that redefining happens.</p>
<p>In the case of global modifier, its properties can be redefined by the blocks if they follow modifiers in code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.hidden { display: none }
/* ... */
.block { display: block }
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;block hidden&quot;&gt;you still see me&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of the possible solutions to this problem is to raise the selector specificity of global modifiers by adding <code>!important</code> to them.
But in this case any side-effects of such a global modifier might be overwritten only by declarations with the same <code>!important</code>
instruction.</p>
<p>Another way is to load global modifier CSS after al the other styles. But in this case you are not able any more to use <em>lazy
loading</em> strategy for your components. The additional lazy CSS will still be loaded after the modifiers and you get the same problem.</p>
<p>The next problem is combination of several global modifiers at the same block.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;block mod1 mod2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case you absolutely have no control over the block. The order of modifiers in code can be different. If it conflicts
with other declarations, changing the order can fix this conflict but lead to another one. The only way would be to redefine the mess
in block. And don&#39;t forget about the <code>!important</code> to your hack.</p>
<p>Also, depending on a block the same modifier can be implemented differently. Even the simple <code>.hidden</code> sometimes needs to be
not <code>display: none</code> but <code>visibility: hidden</code> or even <code>postition: ablosulte; left: -9999px</code> etc. And if you need to bring some changes
into your block, it is much nicer not to waste time searching for all the places where this block can be combined with a global modifier.
Espacially assuming that such dependencies usually are not described anywhere.</p>
<p>All this hell can be avoided by encapsulating a modifier in a block like <code>.block_mod</code>.</p>
<p>Indeed using global modifiers makes the resultant code less. However if you measure the real difference in bytes it usually does not
seem that big. Especially if you are using CSS optimizator which can combine selectors.</p>

          </div><a id="encapsulating-tag-selector"></a>
          <div class="raw-text"><h2 id="can-i-combine-a-tag-and-a-class-in-selector-like-button-button-">Can I combine a tag and a class in selector like <code>button.button</code>?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to use selectors like <code>button.button</code> to encapsulate my blocks functionality within a particular tag.
If lately someone else would use in their code <code>&lt;h2 class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;</code>, such an encapsulation would prevent
a conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CSS specificity of such a selector grows. <code>.button_mod</code> selector will not overwrite CSS properties of the block, only
<code>button.button_mod</code> would work. You will need its modifiers to be combined with the tag as well and so do the developers
who lately would redefine your block.</p>
<p>Lately, when a project goes larger, it&#39;s very likely that you may have <code>input.button</code>, <code>span.button</code> and <code>a.button</code>
as well. And all the prefixed selectors for modifiers and nested elements will need 4 declarations.</p>
<p>So, it is better not to tie your own hands with such prefixing. However if you still can softly-softly ensure that
your blocks are used with proper tags if your provide your users with templates for every block. This is the most
flexible and automatic solution.</p>
<p>If the templating looks overhead, the is a &quot;documentation&quot; approach to inform your users which tag the block CSS class
would be applied to, this
can be done with documenting the block code. The shortest version could be just a comment with a tag name prefixing
the block declaration <code>/*button*/.button</code>. Or that can be a larger comment with full HTML piece needed to the
block to function.</p>
